       "'I hoped for Mia to have some peace in this book, but her story is so real and raw.  Broken World was so touching and emotional because you go from Mia\\'s trauma to her trying to cope.  I love the way the story displays how there is no \"just bouncing back\" from being sexually assaulted.  Mia showed us how those demons come for you every day and how sometimes they best you. I was so in the moment with Broken World and hurt with Mia because she was surrounded by people but so alone and I understood her feelings.  I found myself wishing I could give her some of my courage and strength or even just to be there for her.  Thank you Lizzy for putting a great character\\'s voice on a strong subject and making it so that other peoples story may be heard through Mia\\'s.'"

      "***received an arc in exchange for an honest review***I was excited to read this book after reading the first in the series Connected By The Sea. I was interested in reading Henry's story after being introduced to his character in Sydney's story. I was slightly disappointed to say the least. There were so many scenes that had me scratching my head in confusion. The idea that Henry was so in love with Sydney that he thought his life was over because she rejected him to fall completely and madly in love with Renee so quickly and profess more then once that he had no feelings what so ever for Sydney seemed a little far fetched to me. The fact the he was honest with Renee and told her about his feelings for someone else and her be okay with it and want to be with him anyway didn't seemPlausible...I kept thinking in my head what woman would do that. Some of the sex scenes had me skimming...especially the masterbation ones. I didn't understand why Henry would feel like a pervert for being attracted to someone other then Sydney. I can understand him struggling with it because of his feelings, having feelings for two people at the same time but to feel like a pervert because of that was a little odd to me. The lovey dovey behavior was a little over the top for me and I have read my share of all different types of love stories. I was sorry that this book was a disappointment, I had expected more after reading book 1....\n",
