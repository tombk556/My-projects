In this application I like to extract all my financial stock data about my portfolio into a dashboard which will be updated each week 
Content:
- Stock information in euro about all my stocks I have
- Graphical and tabluar visualize 
- Email notification at the end of the week (friday at 5 pm)
- Future prediction 


Technical requirements:
- no hard coded stuff
- use OOP to define classes which:
    - extract the data, store the data in a database 
    - calcualte the current assets and net-worth
    - visualize the data 
    - ...


File main.py:
- enkripts all classes


File data_extraction.py:
- define a class which can be acess in the main file to extract the data from yahoo finance
- make sure to add the following attributes:
    - date of extraction - end - now 
    - name of the stock - no ticker!

- possible problems: ticker symbol on yahoo finance, currency for us stocks!

File data_storage:
- create an interactive database that stores the data from the stocks which are extracted from the file data_extraction
- create for each stock a datatable in the database
- create a menu to access the data and view them
- delete the data if necessary ...
-------------------------------
FOR NOW!!! THIS IDEA IS ON HOLD!!!

File data_storage:
- create an excel file which stores each stock in a excel sheet
